sensors that we need for measuring heath  
heart rate -oximeter (Blood Oxygen) - Diabetes Diagnosis- blood pressure - body heat 

> 1- Max30100 - (Blood Oxygen & Heart rate BPM).\
> 2- LM35 Temperature Sensor.\
i think [e-Health Sensor Shield](https://www.cooking-hacks.com/ehealth-sensor-shield-biometric-medical-arduino-raspberry-pi.html) is agood recomendation\
